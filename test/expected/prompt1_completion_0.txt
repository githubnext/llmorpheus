Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name === undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is `undefined`. If `name` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or `false`), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the object with the `id`, `name`, `timezones`, and `allTimezones` properties.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
name !== 'foo'
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `name` is falsy, while this new code fragment checks if `name` is not equal to the string `'foo'`. If `name` is any other falsy value (such as `null` or `false`), the original code fragment would return `null`, while this new code fragment would return the object with the `id`, `name`, `timezones`, and `allTimezones` properties.
