We plan to apply mutation testing to the following code:
<BEGIN>
{{{code}}}
<END>

Please state the three most likely code fragments that the PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with. 
Important: the code fragments must use different variables, functions, or constants than code indicated 
in the comment on the same line.

Provide your answer as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code, 
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
