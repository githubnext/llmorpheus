  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This would cause the `insert` method to behave differently when `this.right` is null, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is null using the strict equality operator. This would cause the `insert` method to behave differently when `this.right` is null, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right !== null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is not null using the strict inequality operator. This would cause the `
