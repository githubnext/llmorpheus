  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
newIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would start inserting elements at the wrong index, potentially overwriting existing elements in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always insert elements at the end of the list, regardless of their order.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
Math.random() * list.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would insert elements at a random position in the list, potentially causing the list to become unsorted.

DONE.
