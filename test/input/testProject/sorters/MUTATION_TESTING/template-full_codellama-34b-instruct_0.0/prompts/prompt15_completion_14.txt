  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `copyInto` method is now `1` instead of `0`, which would cause the method to start copying the elements of the tree into the list at a different index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, list.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `copyInto` method is now `list.length` instead of `0`, which would cause the method to start copying the elements of the tree into the list at the end of the list instead of at the beginning.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, list.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the second argument of the `copyInto` method is now `list.length - 1` instead of `0`, which would cause the method to start copying the elements of the tree into the list at the second-to-last index of
