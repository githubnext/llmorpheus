  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the value of `v` to be incremented by 1, which would change the order of the elements in the sorted list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the value of `v` to be decremented by 1, which would also change the order of the elements in the sorted list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the value of `v` to be multiplied by 2, which would change the order of the elements in the sorted list.

DONE.
