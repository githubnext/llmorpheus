  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v, this.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the comparison to always be greater than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the right subtree instead of the left subtree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v, this.value - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the comparison to always be less than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the left subtree instead of the right subtree.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
v, this.value * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the comparison to always be greater than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the right subtree instead of the left subtree.

DONE.
