  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.left` is a reference to the left child node of the current node, whereas `this.value` is the value stored in the current node.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.right` is a reference to the right child node of the current node, whereas `this.value` is the value stored in the current node.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.value + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because `this.value + 1` is a different value than `this.value`, and would cause the tree to be sorted differently.

DONE.
