  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list[i+1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would skip the first element of the list and start inserting from the second element.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list[i-1]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start inserting from the previous element of the list, instead of the current element.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list[i*2]
```
This would result in different behavior because it would start inserting from the double of the current element of the list, instead of the current element.

DONE.
