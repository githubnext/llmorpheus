Mutation testing is a technique that involves modifying a program in small ways, in
order to find weaknesses in a project's test suite. The goal is to change the
behavior of the program, and then check whether the tests notice. When they do
not, that indicates that the tests may not be as effective as the developer
might have hoped.

Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
<BEGIN>
{{{code}}}
<END>

Please state three possible fragments that the PLACEHOLDER could be replaced with. 
The change must involve AT LEAST one of the following:
  - a variable must be referenced that was not used in the original code fragment
	- an object property must be referenced that was not used in the original code fragment
	- a function or method must be called that was not used in the original code fragment

Provide your answer as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code, 
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This change involves accessing <list the affected variables, functions, or object properties> that are not accessed in the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This change involves accessing <list the affected variables, functions, or object properties> that are not accessed in the original code.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This change involves accessing <list the affected variables, functions, or object properties> that are not accessed in the original code.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
