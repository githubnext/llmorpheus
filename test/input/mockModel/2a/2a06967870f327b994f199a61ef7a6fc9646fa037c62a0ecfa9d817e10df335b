["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezone(data, name)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function is not being called with the correct arguments. The original code fragment called `buildTimezone` with the `data` and `name` arguments, but the new code fragment only passes the `name` argument.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezone(data, name, true)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function is being called with an additional argument, which could cause the function to behave differently.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezone(data, name, false)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildTimezone` function is being called with a different value for the `deprecated` argument.\n\nDONE."]
