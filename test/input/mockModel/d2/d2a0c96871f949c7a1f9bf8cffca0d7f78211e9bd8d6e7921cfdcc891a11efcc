["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would increment the `prev` value by 1, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would multiply the `prev` value by 2, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would decrement the `prev` value by 1, which would cause the `reduce()` method to produce a different output.\n\nDONE."]
