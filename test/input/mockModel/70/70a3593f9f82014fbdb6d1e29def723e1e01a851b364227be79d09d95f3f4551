["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzName + \"foo\"\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would append the string \"foo\" to the timezone name, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzName.toUpperCase()\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would convert the timezone name to uppercase, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzName.split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\")\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would reverse the characters in the timezone name, which would cause the `getTimezone` function to return a different result.\n\nDONE."]
