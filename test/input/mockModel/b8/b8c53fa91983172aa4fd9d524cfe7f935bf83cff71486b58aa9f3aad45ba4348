["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nmemoizeTimezone\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `memoizeTimezone` is a different function than `memoizeCountry`, and it would not have the same effect on the program's behavior.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nmemoizeCountry(timezone)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `memoizeCountry` expects a `country` object as its argument, but `timezone` is a `timezone` object. Calling `memoizeCountry` with a `timezone` object would cause an error.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nmemoizeCountry(country)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `memoizeCountry` expects a `country` object as its argument, but `country` is a `country` object. Calling `memoizeCountry` with a `country` object would cause an error.\n\nDONE."]
