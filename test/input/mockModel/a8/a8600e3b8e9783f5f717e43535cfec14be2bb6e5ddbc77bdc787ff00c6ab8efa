["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.filter\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.reduce\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `reduce` returns a single value produced by combining the elements of the array using a provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.find\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `find` returns the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nDONE."]
