["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezonesMap(data.timezones)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones` object as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezonesMap(data.timezones.all)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones.all` array as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildTimezonesMap(data.timezones.current)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would call the `buildTimezonesMap` function with the `data.timezones.current` array as an argument, which would return a different object than the original code fragment.\n\nDONE"]
