["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.filter\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `filter` returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.slice\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `slice` returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nvalues.reduce\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value, while `map` returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element.\n\nDONE."]
