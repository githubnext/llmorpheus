["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ngetTimezone(name)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would call the `getTimezone` function with the `name` argument, which would return a timezone object with the `name` property set to the value of the `name` argument. In the original code, the `getTimezone` function is called without any arguments, which would return a timezone object with the `name` property set to the value of the `name` property of the `timezone` object.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntimezones[name]\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would return the timezone object with the `name` property set to the value of the `name` argument, without calling the `getTimezone` function.
