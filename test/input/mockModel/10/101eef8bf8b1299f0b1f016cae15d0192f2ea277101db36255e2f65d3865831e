["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noffset % 60\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while this replacement code uses the modulo operator to calculate the number of minutes. This would cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noffset / 61\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while this replacement code uses a different divisor. This would cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noffset / 60 + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses integer division to calculate the number of hours, while this replacement code uses a different divisor and adds 1 to the result. This would cause the resulting offset string to be incorrect.\n\nDONE."]
