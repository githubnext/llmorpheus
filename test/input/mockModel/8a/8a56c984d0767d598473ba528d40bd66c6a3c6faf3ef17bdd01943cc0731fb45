["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ngetOffsetStr(dstOffset)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, `dstOffset`, which may have a different value than `utcOffset`.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ngetOffsetStr(utcOffset + 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, `utcOffset + 1`, which may have a different value than `utcOffset`.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ngetOffsetStr(dstOffset + 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `getOffsetStr` function is called with a different argument, `dstOffset + 1`, which may have a different value than `dstOffset`.\n\nDONE."]
