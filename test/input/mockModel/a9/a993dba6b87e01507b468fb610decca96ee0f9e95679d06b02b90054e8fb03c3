["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndeprecated !== true\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is `true`, while this replacement checks if it is not `true`. This would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different set of timezones.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n!deprecated\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `deprecated` is `true`, while this replacement checks if it is not `false`.
