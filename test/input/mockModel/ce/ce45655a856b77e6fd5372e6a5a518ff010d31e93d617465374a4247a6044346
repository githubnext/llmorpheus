["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noptions.deprecated = true;\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would always return the deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is not set to `true`.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noptions.deprecated = false;\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would always return the non-deprecated timezones, even if the `deprecated` option is set to `true`.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\noptions.deprecated = !options.deprecated;\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would toggle the `deprecated` option, causing the function to return the opposite of what it would normally return.\n\nDONE."]
