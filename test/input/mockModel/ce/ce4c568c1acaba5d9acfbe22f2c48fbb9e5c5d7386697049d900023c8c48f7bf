["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id + 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is incremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id * 2)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id - 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `id` parameter is decremented by 1, which would cause the `buildCountry` function to return a different country.\n\nDONE."]
