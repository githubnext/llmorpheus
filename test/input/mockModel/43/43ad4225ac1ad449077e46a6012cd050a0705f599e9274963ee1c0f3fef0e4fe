["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ninput + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `input` variable directly, while this modified code fragment adds 1 to the `input` variable before using it. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ninput * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `input` variable directly, while this modified code fragment multiplies the `input` variable by 2 before using it. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ninput / 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `input` variable directly, while this modified code fragment divides the `input` variable by 2 before using it. This could cause the resulting offset string to be different from the original.\n\nDONE."]
