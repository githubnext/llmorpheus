["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountries[id]\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the resulting value would be the opposite of what it was before.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountries[id] === undefined\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `===` operator checks for strict equality, so the resulting value would be `true` if `countries[id]` is `undefined`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nObject.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(countries, id)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `hasOwnProperty` method checks if the object has the specified property as its own property, so the resulting value would be `true` if `countries` has the property `id`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nDONE."]
