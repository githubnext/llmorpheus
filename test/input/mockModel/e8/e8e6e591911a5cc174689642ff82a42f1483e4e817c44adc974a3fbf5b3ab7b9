["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountry === null\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `country === null` would check if the `country` variable is null, while `!country` would check if the `country` variable is falsy (i.e., null, undefined, 0, false, etc.).\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountry.length === 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `country.length === 0` would check if the `country` variable is an empty string, while `!country` would check if the `country` variable is falsy.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountry.timezones.length === 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `country.timezones.length === 0` would check if the `timezones` property of the `country` variable is an empty array, while `!country` would check if the `country` variable is falsy.\n\nDONE"]
