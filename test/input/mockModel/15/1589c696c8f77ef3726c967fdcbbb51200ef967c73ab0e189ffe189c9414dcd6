["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId + 1, options\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `countryId` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different country than the one intended.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId, options + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be incremented by 1, which could cause the function to return a different set of timezones than the ones intended.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId, { deprecated: true }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `options` parameter would be set to `{ deprecated: true }`, which would cause the function to return only deprecated timezones for the specified country, rather than all timezones.\n\nDONE."]
