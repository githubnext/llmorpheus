["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nMath.ceil\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Math.ceil` rounds up to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer. This could cause the offset calculation to be off by one hour in certain cases.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nMath.round\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Math.round` rounds to the nearest integer, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer. This could cause the offset calculation to be off by half an hour in certain cases.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nMath.trunc\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Math.trunc` removes the fractional part of a number, while `Math.floor` rounds down to the nearest integer. This could cause the offset calculation to be off by a fraction of an hour in certain cases.\n\nDONE."]
