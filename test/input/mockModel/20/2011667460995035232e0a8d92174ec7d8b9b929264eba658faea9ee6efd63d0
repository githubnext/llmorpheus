["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndata, name + \"foo\"\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `+ \"foo\"` would cause the `name` variable to be concatenated with the string \"foo\", which would change the resulting timezone name.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndata, name * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the `name` variable to be multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting timezone name.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndata, name.toUpperCase()\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would cause the `name` variable to be converted to uppercase, which would change the resulting timezone name.\n\nDONE."]
