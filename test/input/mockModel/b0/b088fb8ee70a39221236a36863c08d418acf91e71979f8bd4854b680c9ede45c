["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n{ [key]: tzs[key] + 1 }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property is incremented by 1, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code fragment.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n{ [key]: tzs[key] - 1 }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property is decremented by 1, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code fragment.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n{ [key]: tzs[key] * 2 }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the value of the `tzs[key]` property is multiplied by 2, which would cause the `deliverTimezones` function to return a different result than the original code fragment"]
