["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist, newIndex + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is incremented before it is used to insert the current node's value into the list, which would cause the list to be filled with the wrong values.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist, newIndex - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is decremented before it is used to insert the current node's value into the list, which would cause the list to be filled with the wrong values.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist, newIndex * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is multiplied by 2 before it is used to insert the current node's value into the list, which would cause the list to be filled with the wrong values.\n\nDONE."]
