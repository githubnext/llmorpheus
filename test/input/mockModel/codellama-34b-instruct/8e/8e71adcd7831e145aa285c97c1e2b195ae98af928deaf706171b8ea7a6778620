["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return 1, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the same result, regardless of the input list.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n-1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return -1, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the opposite result, regardless of the input list.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist.length\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return the length of the input list, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the same result, regardless of the input list.\n\nDONE."]
