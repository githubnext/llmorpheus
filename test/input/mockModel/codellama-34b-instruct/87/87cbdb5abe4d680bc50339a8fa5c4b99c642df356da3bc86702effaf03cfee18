["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.left.insert\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the left child instead of the right child, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right.insert(v, compareFun);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the right child with a different comparison function, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right.insert(v, (e1, e2) => e2 - e1);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the right child with a different comparison function that sorts in descending order instead of ascending order, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.\n\nDONE."]
