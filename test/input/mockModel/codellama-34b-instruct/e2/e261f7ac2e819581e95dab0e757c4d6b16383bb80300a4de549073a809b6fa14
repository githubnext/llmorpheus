["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would cause the value of `v` to be incremented by 1, which would change the order of the elements in the sorted list.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would cause the value of `v` to be decremented by 1, which would also change the order of the elements in the sorted list.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would cause the value of `v` to be multiplied by 2, which would change the order of the elements in the sorted list.\n\nDONE."]
