["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv, this.value + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` would cause the comparison to always be greater than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the right subtree instead of the left subtree.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv, this.value - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `- 1` would cause the comparison to always be less than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the left subtree instead of the right subtree.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nv, this.value * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `* 2` would cause the comparison to always be greater than 0, resulting in the element being inserted into the right subtree instead of the left subtree.\n\nDONE."]
