["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right == null\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This would cause the `copyInto` method to behave differently when `this.right` is null, potentially leading to incorrect results.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right.length > 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the length of `this.right` is greater than 0. This would cause the `copyInto` method to behave differently when `this.right` is an empty array, potentially leading to incorrect results.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right.length == 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment"]
