["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist.slice()\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `list.slice()` creates a new array, whereas `list` is a reference to the original array. This could cause the `copyInto` method to insert elements into the wrong array, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist.splice(0, 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `list.splice(0, 1)` removes the first element of the array, whereas `list` is a reference to the original array. This could cause the `copyInto` method to insert elements into the wrong array, leading to unexpected behavior.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist.concat([])\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `list.concat([])` creates a new array by concatenating the original array with an empty array, whereas `list` is a reference to the original array. This could cause the `copyInto`"]
