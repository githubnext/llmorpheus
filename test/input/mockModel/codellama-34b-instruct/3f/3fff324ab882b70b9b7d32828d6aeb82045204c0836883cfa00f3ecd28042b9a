["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncompareFun(v, this.value) > 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is reversed, causing the tree to be built with the opposite ordering.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncompareFun(v, this.value) == 0\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for equality, causing the tree to be built with duplicate values.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncompareFun(v, this.value) < 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for less than or equal to, causing the tree to be built with a different set of values.\n\nDONE."]
