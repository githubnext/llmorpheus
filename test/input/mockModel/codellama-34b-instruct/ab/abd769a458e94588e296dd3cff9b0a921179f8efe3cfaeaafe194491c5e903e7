["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.left.copyInto\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the opposite order, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right.copyInto(list, newIndex + 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the same order, but with an additional offset, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.left.copyInto(list, newIndex - 1)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the opposite order, with a negative offset, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.\n\nDONE."]
