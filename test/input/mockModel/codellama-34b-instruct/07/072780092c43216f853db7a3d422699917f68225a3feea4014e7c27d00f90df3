["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nnewIndex + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would start inserting elements at the wrong index, potentially overwriting existing elements in the list.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nlist.length\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always insert elements at the end of the list, regardless of their order.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nMath.floor(Math.random() * list.length)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would insert elements at a random index in the list, potentially causing the list to become unsorted.\n\nDONE."]
