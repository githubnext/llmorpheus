["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nconsole.error\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `console.error` would log the message to the console with a higher level of severity than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the higher level of severity.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nconsole.warn\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `console.warn` would log the message to the console with a lower level of severity than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the lower level of severity.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nconsole.info\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `console.info` would log the message to the console with a lower level of severity than `console.log`, which could potentially cause the test suite to fail if it is not expecting the lower level of severity.\n\nDONE."]
