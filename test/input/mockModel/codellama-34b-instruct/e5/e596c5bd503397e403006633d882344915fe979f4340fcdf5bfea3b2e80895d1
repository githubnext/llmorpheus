["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntree.copyInto(list, index + 1);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter is incremented by 1, which would cause the `copyInto` method to start inserting elements at the wrong index.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntree.copyInto(list, index - 1);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter is decremented by 1, which would cause the `copyInto` method to start inserting elements at the wrong index.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntree.copyInto(list, index + list.length);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `index` parameter is incremented by the length of the `list` array, which would cause the `copyInto` method to start inserting elements at the wrong index.\n\nDONE."]
