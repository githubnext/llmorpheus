["  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.left\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `this.left` is a reference to the left child node of the current node, whereas `this.value` is the value stored in the current node.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.right\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `this.right` is a reference to the right child node of the current node, whereas `this.value` is the value stored in the current node.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nthis.value + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `this.value + 1` is a different value than `this.value`, and would cause the tree to be sorted differently.\n\nDONE."]
