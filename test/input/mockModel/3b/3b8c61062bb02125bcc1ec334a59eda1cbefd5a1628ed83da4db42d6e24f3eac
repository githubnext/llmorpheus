["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzs[key].deprecated\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `!` operator is negating the expression, so the resulting value would be the opposite of what it should be.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzs[key].deprecated === true\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `===` operator is checking for strict equality, so the resulting value would be `true` if the `deprecated` property is `true`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzs[key].deprecated !== true\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `!==` operator is checking for strict inequality, so the resulting value would be `true` if the `deprecated` property is not `true`, and `false` otherwise.\n\nDONE."]
