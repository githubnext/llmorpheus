["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is not memoized, meaning that it will be called every time the `getCountry` function is called, even if the country with the given `id` has already been built. This could lead to a significant performance impact if the `buildCountry` function is computationally expensive.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id, true)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is now being called with an additional argument, which could cause it to behave differently. For example, if the `buildCountry` function is designed to handle a specific number of arguments, passing an additional argument could cause it to throw an error.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nbuildCountry(data, id, false)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `buildCountry` function is now being called with a different set of arguments, which"]
