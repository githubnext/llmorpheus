["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev, { [id]: getTimezone(id, options) }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `getTimezone` and `getCountry` have different return types, and the `reduce` function would produce a different output.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).timezones }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `getCountry` returns an object with a `timezones` property, and the `reduce` function would produce a different output.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nprev, { [id]: getCountry(id, options).allTimezones }\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `getCountry` returns an object with an `allTimezones` property, and the `reduce` function would produce a different output.\n\nDONE."]
