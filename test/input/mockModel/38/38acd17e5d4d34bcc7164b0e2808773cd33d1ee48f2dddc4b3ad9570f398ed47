["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\n!Number.isInteger\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `!Number.isInteger` would always return `false`, even if the input is an integer.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nNumber.isNaN\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Number.isNaN` would return `true` if the input is `NaN`, which is not the same as an integer.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nNumber.isFinite\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Number.isFinite` would return `false` if the input is `Infinity`, which is not the same as an integer.\n\nDONE."]
