["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country] = { current: [], all: [] };\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would overwrite the existing `result[country]` object with a new object, losing any existing data.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country] = { current: result[country].current.slice(), all: result[country].all.slice() };\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would create a shallow copy of the `result[country]` object, which would not affect the original data.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country] = { current: result[country].current.concat(id), all: result[country].all.concat(id) };\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would add the `id` to the `current` and `all` arrays, which would affect the data in the `result` object.\n\nDONE."]
