["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country].all.push(id);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would push the `id` to the `all` array instead of the `current` array, which could cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect results.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country].all.push(tz.r);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `tz.r` to the `all` array instead of the `current` array, which could cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect results.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nresult[country].all.push(aliasTz.r);\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would push the value of `aliasTz.r` to the `all` array instead of the `current` array, which could cause the `buildCountry` function to return incorrect results.\n\nDONE."]
