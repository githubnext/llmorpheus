["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nname.toUpperCase()\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the `name` string to uppercase, which may not be the desired behavior.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nname.length\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `length` property would return the length of the `name` string, which may not be the desired behavior.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nname.split('')\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `split()` method would split the `name` string into an array of individual characters, which may not be the desired behavior.\n\nDONE."]
