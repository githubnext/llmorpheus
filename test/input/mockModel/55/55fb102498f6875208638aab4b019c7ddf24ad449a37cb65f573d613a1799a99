["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `+ 1` operator would add 1 to the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `* 2` operator would double the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountryId - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `- 1` operator would subtract 1 from the `countryId` value, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a different country than the one intended.\n\nDONE."]
