["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountries[id] = null;\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would set the country object to null, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return null, even if the country exists in the `countries` object.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountries[id] = undefined;\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would set the country object to undefined, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return undefined, even if the country exists in the `countries` object.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ncountries[id] = { ...countries[id], deprecated: true };\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because it would set the `deprecated` property of the country object to true, which would cause the `getCountry` function to return a deprecated country object, even if the country is not deprecated.\n\nDONE."]
