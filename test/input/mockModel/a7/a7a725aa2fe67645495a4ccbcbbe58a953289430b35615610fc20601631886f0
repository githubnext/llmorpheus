["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nObject.keys\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Object.keys` returns an array of keys, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new properties.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nObject.values\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Object.values` returns an array of values, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new properties.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nObject.entries\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Object.entries` returns an array of key-value pairs, while `Object.assign` returns a new object with the properties of the original object and the new properties.\n\nDONE."]
