["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\nObject.keys(tzs)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `Object.keys()` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object, while `tzs` itself is an object.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzs.length\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `tzs.length` returns the number of elements in the `tzs` array, while `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing the keys of the `tzs` object.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ntzs.filter(t => t.deprecated)\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because `tzs.filter(t => t.deprecated)` returns a new array containing only the elements of `tzs` that have a `deprecated` property set to `true`, while `Object.keys(tzs)` returns an array of strings representing all the keys of the `tz"]
