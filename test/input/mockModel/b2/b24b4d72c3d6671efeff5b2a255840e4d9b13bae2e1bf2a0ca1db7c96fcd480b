["Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndstOffset + 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be incremented by 1, which would change the resulting `dstOffsetStr` value.\n\nOption 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndstOffset * 2\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be multiplied by 2, which would change the resulting `dstOffsetStr` value.\n\nOption 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:\n```\ndstOffset - 1\n```\nThis would result in different behavior because the `dstOffset` value would be decremented by 1, which would change the resulting `dstOffsetStr` value.\n\nDONE."]
