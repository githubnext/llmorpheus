  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i--
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would decrement the index instead of incrementing it, potentially causing the loop to never terminate or to skip over certain elements in the list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i += 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would skip over every other element in the list, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or to miss certain elements.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i = list.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start at the end of the list instead of the beginning, potentially causing the loop to terminate prematurely or to miss certain elements.

DONE.
