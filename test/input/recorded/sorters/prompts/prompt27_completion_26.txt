  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left.insert
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the left child instead of the right child, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.insert(v, compareFun);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the right child with a different comparison function, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.insert(v, (e1, e2) => e2 - e1);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `insert` method is called on the right child with a different comparison function that sorts in descending order instead of ascending order, which could lead to a different tree structure and potentially different sorting results.

DONE.
