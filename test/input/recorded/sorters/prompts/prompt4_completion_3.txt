  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i: number = 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the first element instead of the second element, which could cause the first element to be skipped in the sorting process.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i: number = list.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the last element instead of the second element, which could cause the last element to be skipped in the sorting process.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
let i: number = Math.floor(list.length / 2)
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would start from the middle element instead of the second element, which could cause the middle element to be skipped in the sorting process.

DONE.
