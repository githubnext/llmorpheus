  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right == null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if it is null. This would cause the `copyInto` method to behave differently when `this.right` is null, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.length > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if the length of `this.right` is greater than 0. This would cause the `copyInto` method to behave differently when `this.right` is an empty array, potentially leading to incorrect results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.length == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null, while the new code fragment
