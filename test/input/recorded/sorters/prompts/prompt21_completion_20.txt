  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left === null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.left` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if `this.left` is null. This change would cause the `insert` method to always create a new tree node, even if one already exists, which could lead to duplicate data in the tree.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right != null
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.left` is not null, while the new code fragment checks if `this.right` is not null. This change would cause the `insert` method to always insert new elements into the right subtree, even if the left subtree is empty, which could lead to an unbalanced tree.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left.value === v
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment checks if `this.left`
