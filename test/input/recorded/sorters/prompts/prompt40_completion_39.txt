  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, newIndex + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is incremented before it is used to insert the value into the list, which would cause the value to be inserted at the wrong index.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, newIndex - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is decremented before it is used to insert the value into the list, which would cause the value to be inserted at the wrong index.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list, newIndex * 2
```
This would result in different behavior because the `newIndex` variable is multiplied by 2 before it is used to insert the value into the list, which would cause the value to be inserted at the wrong index.

DONE.
