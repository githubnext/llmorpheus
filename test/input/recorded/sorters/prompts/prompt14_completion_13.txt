  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return 1, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the same result, regardless of the input list.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
-1
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return -1, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the opposite result, regardless of the input list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
list.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the `copyInto` method would always return the length of the input list, regardless of the input list, which would cause the `sort` method to always return the same result, regardless of the input list.

DONE.
