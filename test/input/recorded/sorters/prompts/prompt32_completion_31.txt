  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.copyInto
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the opposite order, potentially leading to incorrect sorting.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left.copyInto(list, index + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the same order, but with an offset of 1, potentially leading to incorrect sorting.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.copyInto(list, index - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the same order, but with an offset of -1, potentially leading to incorrect sorting.

DONE.
