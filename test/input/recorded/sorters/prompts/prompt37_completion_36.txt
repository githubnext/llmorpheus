  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left.copyInto
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the opposite order, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.right.copyInto(list, newIndex + 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the same order, but with an additional offset, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
this.left.copyInto(list, newIndex - 1)
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the tree to be traversed in the opposite order, with a negative offset, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results.

DONE.
