  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` variable is now converted to lowercase, which could cause issues if the `format` variable is used in other parts of the code that expect it to be in uppercase.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` variable is now converted to uppercase, which could cause issues if the `format` variable is used in other parts of the code that expect it to be in lowercase.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
format.replace('zip', 'tar')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `format` variable is now replaced with 'tar' if it contains the string 'zip', which could cause issues if the `format` variable is used in other parts of the code that expect it to be 'zip'.

DONE.
