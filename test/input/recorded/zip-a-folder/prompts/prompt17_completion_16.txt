  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath + '/'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of `targetBasePath` and `'/'` would create a new path that is not the same as `targetBasePath`. This would cause the `fs.promises.access` function to throw an error, which would result in the `Permission error` message being thrown.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase` method would convert the `targetBasePath` string to lowercase, which would cause the `fs.promises.access` function to throw an error if the file path is not in lowercase. This would result in the `Permission error` message being thrown.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.replace(/ /g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would remove all spaces from the `targetBasePath` string
