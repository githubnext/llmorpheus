  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toLowerCase()` method would convert the glob pattern to lowercase, which could affect the matching behavior of the `glob()` method.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase()` method would convert the glob pattern to uppercase, which could affect the matching behavior of the `glob()` method.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
globPart.replace(/[a-z]/g, 'A')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace()` method would replace all lowercase letters in the glob pattern with uppercase letters, which could affect the matching behavior of the `glob()` method.

DONE.
