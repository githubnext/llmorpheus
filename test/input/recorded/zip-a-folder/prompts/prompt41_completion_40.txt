  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'*'
```
This would result in different behavior because the glob pattern would match all files in the directory, rather than just the files that match the original pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'**'
```
This would result in different behavior because the glob pattern would match all files in the directory and all subdirectories, rather than just the files that match the original pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'?'
```
This would result in different behavior because the glob pattern would match any single character, rather than just the files that match the original pattern.

DONE.
