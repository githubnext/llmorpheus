  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK & fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise AND operator would only allow the file to be accessed if it has both read and write permissions, whereas the original code fragment would allow the file to be accessed if it has either read or write permissions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the bitwise OR operator would allow the file to be accessed if it has any of the permissions (read, write, or execute), whereas the original code fragment would only allow the file to be accessed if it has both read and write permissions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK | fs.constants.X_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because
