  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `true`, causing the `zipArchive.directory(src, true)` line to be executed, which would include all files and subdirectories in the `src` directory, regardless of whether they match the glob pattern or not.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `zipArchive.directory(src, undefined)` line to be executed, which would include only the files and subdirectories in the `src` directory that match the glob pattern, but would not include any files or subdirectories that do not match the pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `if` statement would always evaluate to `false`, causing the `zipArchive.directory(src, null)` line to be executed, which would
