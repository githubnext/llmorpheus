  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { gzip: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable gzip compression for the archiver, which is not the default behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { zlib: { level: 9 } }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would set the compression level to 9, which is the highest level of compression available.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
archiverOptions || { store: true }
```
This would result in different behavior because it would enable store mode for the archiver, which would not compress the data.

DONE.
