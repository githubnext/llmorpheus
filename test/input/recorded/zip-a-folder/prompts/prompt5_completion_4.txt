  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream || targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `||` operator has a higher precedence than the `&&` operator, so the `targetFilePath` would be evaluated first, and then the `!zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` would be evaluated. This could result in a different error message being thrown if the `targetFilePath` is not a valid path.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream && targetFilePath
```
This would result in different behavior because the `&&` operator has a higher precedence than the `||` operator, so the `targetFilePath` would be evaluated first, and then the `zipAFolderOptions?.customWriteStream` would be evaluated. This could result in a different error message being thrown if the `targetFilePath` is not a valid path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
