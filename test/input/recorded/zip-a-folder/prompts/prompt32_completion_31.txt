  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('close', resolve)` event listener would be triggered when the output stream is closed, which would resolve the promise and end the function.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('finish', resolve)` event listener would be triggered when the output stream is finished writing all the data, which would resolve the promise and end the function.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'error'
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('error', reject)` event listener would be triggered when an error occurs while writing to the output stream, which would reject the promise and end the function.

DONE.
