  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to write to the source directory, which is not intended.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to write to the target directory, which is not intended.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
fs.promises.access(src, fs.constants.R_OK);
```
This would result in different behavior because it would allow the code to read from the source directory, which is not intended.

DONE.
