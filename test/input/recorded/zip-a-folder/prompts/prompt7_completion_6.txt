  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the target file path with the string "test" would cause the output file to be written to a different location than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `toUpperCase()` would cause the output file to be written to a different location than the original code, since the uppercase version of the target file path would be used as the output file path.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.replace('test', 'test2')
```
This would result in different behavior because the call to `replace()` would cause the output file to be written to a different location than the original code, since the string "test" would be replaced with "test2" in the output file path.

DONE.
