  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath + 'test'
```
This would result in different behavior because the concatenation of the target file path with the string "test" would create a new file path that does not exist, causing the `fs.createWriteStream` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `toUpperCase` method would convert the target file path to uppercase, which could cause the `fs.createWriteStream` method to throw an error if the file path contains uppercase characters.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetFilePath.replace(/[a-z]/g, 'A')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `replace` method would replace all lowercase letters in the target file path with the letter "A", which could cause the `fs.createWriteStream` method to throw an error if the file path contains lowercase characters.
