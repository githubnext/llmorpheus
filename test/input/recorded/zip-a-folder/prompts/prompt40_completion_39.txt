  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `src` string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment uses the `split` method with a comma as the separator to split the `src` string into an array of substrings. This would result in different behavior if the `src` string contains commas, as the original code fragment would not split the string on commas, while the new code fragment would.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(' ')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment uses the `split` method to split the `src` string into an array of substrings, while the new code fragment uses the `split` method with a space as the separator to split the `src` string into an array of substrings. This would result in different behavior if the `src` string contains spaces, as the original code fragment would not split the string on spaces, while the new code fragment would
