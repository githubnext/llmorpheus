  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: true,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the `tar` function to use the `compress` method with the `gzip` option set to `true`, which would result in a different compression level than the original code.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
ZipAFolder.compress({
    src,
    targetFilePath: tarFilePath,
    format: 'tar',
    zipAFolderOptions,
    archiverOptions: {
        gzip: false,
        gzipOptions: {
            level: o.compression,
        },
    },
});
```
This would result in different behavior because it would cause the
