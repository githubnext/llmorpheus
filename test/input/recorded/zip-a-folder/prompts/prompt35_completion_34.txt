  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output);
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the zip archive to the output stream, while the new code fragment pipes the output stream to the zip archive. This could potentially cause the zip archive to be written to the output stream in a different order or with different data, which could result in a corrupted archive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.pipe(output, {end: false});
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment pipes the zip archive to the output stream with the `end` option set to `true`, which causes the output stream to be closed after the zip archive is piped. The new code fragment pipes the output stream to the zip archive with the `end` option set to `false`, which allows the output stream to remain open after the zip archive is piped. This could potentially cause the output stream to remain open indefinitely, which could result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Option 3:
