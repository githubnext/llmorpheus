  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
reject
```
This would result in different behavior because the `output.on('close', reject)` event listener would be triggered when the `output` stream is closed, which would cause the promise to be rejected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(null)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with a `null` value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with a `null` value.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
resolve(undefined)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `resolve` function would be called with an `undefined` value, which would cause the promise to be resolved with an `undefined` value.

DONE.
