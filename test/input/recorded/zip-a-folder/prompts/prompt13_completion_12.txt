  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now converted to uppercase before being passed to the `fs.promises.access()` method. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the file path is case-sensitive.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now converted to lowercase before being passed to the `fs.promises.access()` method. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the file path is case-sensitive.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.replace(/ /g, '')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is now stripped of any spaces before being passed to the `fs.promises.access()` method. This could potentially cause the test to fail if the file path contains spaces.

DONE.
