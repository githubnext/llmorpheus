  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to medium instead of high.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to low instead of high.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.uncompressed
```
This would result in different behavior because the compression level would be set to uncompressed instead of high.

DONE.
