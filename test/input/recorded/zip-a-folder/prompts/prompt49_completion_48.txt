  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.finalize(<PLACEHOLDER>);
```
This would result in different behavior because the `finalize` method is called with a different argument.

DONE.
