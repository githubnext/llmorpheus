  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'close', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'error' event and rejects the promise if an error occurs, while the new code fragment listens for the 'close' event and resolves the promise when the output stream is closed. This could potentially cause the promise to resolve before the archiver is finished writing to the output stream, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'finish', resolve
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment listens for the 'error' event and rejects the promise if an error occurs, while the new code fragment listens for the 'finish' event and resolves the promise when the archiver is finished writing to the output stream. This could potentially cause the promise to resolve before the archiver is finished writing to the output stream, leading to unexpected behavior.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
'end', resolve
```
This would result in different
