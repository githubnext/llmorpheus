  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is converted to uppercase, which would affect the behavior of the `zip` and `tar` functions.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is converted to lowercase, which would affect the behavior of the `zip` and `tar` functions.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` variable is split into an array of strings, which would affect the behavior of the `zip` and `tar` functions.

DONE.
