  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, true
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` parameter is now being passed as `true` instead of `false`, which would cause the `directory` method to throw an error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, null
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` parameter is now being passed as `null` instead of `false`, which would cause the `directory` method to throw an error.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src, undefined
```
This would result in different behavior because the `src` parameter is now being passed as `undefined` instead of `false`, which would cause the `directory` method to throw an error.

DONE.
