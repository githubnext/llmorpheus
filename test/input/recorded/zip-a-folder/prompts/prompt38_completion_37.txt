  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
isGlob(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the `isGlob` function is called with the `src` parameter, which is a string, instead of the `src` parameter, which is an array of strings. This would cause the `isGlob` function to return `false` instead of `true`, which would result in the `src` parameter being treated as a single file path instead of a glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the `split` method is called on the `src` parameter, which is a string, instead of the `src` parameter, which is an array of strings. This would cause the `split` method to return an array of strings, each of which is a single character from the original string, instead of an array of strings, each of which is a glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.map((globPart
