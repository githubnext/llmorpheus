  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath !== src
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be false, allowing the code to continue executing even if the source and target folders are the same.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath === src.toLowerCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true if the source and target folders are the same, regardless of case.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath.startsWith(src)
```
This would result in different behavior because the condition would now be true if the source folder is a prefix of the target folder.

DONE.
