  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(src, {dot: true});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is set to `true`, which means that the glob pattern will match dotfiles. In the original code, the `dot` option is not set, so dotfiles are not included in the glob pattern.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(src, {dot: false});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is set to `false`, which means that the glob pattern will not match dotfiles. In the original code, the `dot` option is not set, so dotfiles are not included in the glob pattern.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
zipArchive.glob(src, {dot: undefined});
```
This would result in different behavior because the `dot` option is set to `undefined`, which means that the default behavior of the `glob` method will be used.
