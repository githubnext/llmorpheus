  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.split(',')
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, while `src.split(',')` returns an array of strings. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `src` variable is used in a context where an array is expected.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.toUpperCase()
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, while `src.toUpperCase()` returns a string with all uppercase characters. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `src` variable is used in a context where a string with all uppercase characters is expected.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
src.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the original code fragment `src` is a string, while `src.length` returns the length of the string. This could cause the code to behave differently if the `src` variable is used
