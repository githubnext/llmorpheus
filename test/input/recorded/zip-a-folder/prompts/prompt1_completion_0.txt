  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.high
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` option would be set to `high` instead of `uncompressed`, which would result in a compressed archive being created.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.medium
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` option would be set to `medium` instead of `uncompressed`, which would result in a compressed archive being created with a medium compression level.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
o.compression === COMPRESSION_LEVEL.low
```
This would result in different behavior because the `compression` option would be set to `low` instead of `uncompressed`, which would result in an uncompressed archive being created.

DONE.
