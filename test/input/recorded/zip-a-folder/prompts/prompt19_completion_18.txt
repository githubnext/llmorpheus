  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.W_OK` flag is not included in the `fs.promises.access()` call, which would cause the function to throw an error if the target file path is not writable.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` flag is not included in the `fs.promises.access()` call, which would cause the function to throw an error if the target file path is not readable.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
targetBasePath, fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK
```
This would result in different behavior because the `fs.constants.R_OK` and `fs.constants.W_OK` flags are included
