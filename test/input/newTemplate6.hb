Mutation testing is a technique that involves modifying a program in small ways, in
order to find weaknesses in a project's test suite. The goal is to change the
behavior of the program, and then check whether the tests notice. When they do
not, that indicates that the tests may not be as effective as the developer
might have hoped.

Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
<BEGIN>
{{{code}}}
<END>

Please state the three most likely fragments that the PLACEHOLDER should be replaced with. 
Please do not use the following identifiers unless absolutely necessary:
<BEGIN>
{{{references}}}
<END>

Provide your answer as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code, 
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
