  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i <= list.length
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one extra time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < list.length - 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one less time, potentially missing the last element in the list.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
i < list.length + 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the loop would iterate one more time, potentially causing an index out of bounds error.

DONE.
