  Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compareFun(v, this.value) > 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is reversed, causing the tree to be built with the opposite ordering.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compareFun(v, this.value) == 0
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for equality, causing the tree to be built with duplicate values.

Option 3: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
compareFun(v, this.value) < 1
```
This would result in different behavior because the comparison operator is changed to check for less than or equal to, causing the tree to be built with a different set of values.

DONE.
