Mutation testing is a technique that involves modifying a program in small ways, in
order to find weaknesses in a project's test suite. The goal is to change the
behavior of the program, and then check whether the tests notice. When they do
not, that indicates that the tests may not be as effective as the developer
might have hoped.

Your task is to modify the following code:
```
{{{code}}}
```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a code fragment that behaves differently
than the original code fragment, which was:
```
{{{orig}}}
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide your answers as a fenced code block containing a single line of code, 
using the following template:

The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```
This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
