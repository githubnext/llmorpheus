Your task is to apply mutation testing to the following code:
```
{{{code}}}
```

by replacing the PLACEHOLDER with a buggy code fragment that has different
behavior than the original code fragment, which was:
```
{{{orig}}}
```
Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code,
using the following template:

Option 1: The behavior of the program can be changed by
  <brief informal description of the change and its effects>.
Accordingly, the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 2: The behavior of the program can be changed by
  <brief informal description of the change and its effects>.
Accordingly, the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Option 3: The behavior of the program can be changed by
  <brief informal description of the change and its effects>.
Accordingly, the PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
<code fragment>
```

Please conclude your response with "DONE."
