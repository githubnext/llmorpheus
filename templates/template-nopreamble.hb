Your task is to modify the following code:
```

Please consider changes such as using different operators, changing constants,
referring to different variables, object properties, functions, or methods.  

Provide three answers as fenced code blocks containing a single line of code, 
using the following template:

Option 1: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```

This would result in different behavior because <brief explanation>.

Option 2: The PLACEHOLDER can be replaced with:
```
